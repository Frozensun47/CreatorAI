## Usage Instructions

### Adding Animations to New Components

To add scroll animations to new components, use the utility functions in `animationHelper.js`:

```javascript
import { initScrollAnimations } from '../utils/animationHelper';

// In your component's useEffect:
useEffect(() => {
  initScrollAnimations();
  
  // Clean up when component unmounts
  return () => {
    // Any cleanup code if needed
  };
}, []);
```

### Using CSS Classes for Animations

Add these classes to elements you want to animate:

- `.fade-in` - Simple fade in animation
- `.slide-up` - Slide up from bottom
- `.slide-down` - Slide down from top
- `.slide-left` - Slide in from right
- `.slide-right` - Slide in from left
- `.pulse` - Pulsing animation (good for CTAs)
- `.float` - Floating up and down (good for images)

For scroll-triggered animations, add:
- `.js-scroll` with `.js-scroll--up`, `.js-scroll--down`, etc.
- `.reveal` - Simple reveal animation on scroll

### Using the Common CSS System

Import the common CSS file in your component-specific CSS:

```css
@import '../styles/common.css';

/* Your component styles here */
```

## Browser Compatibility

The enhanced UI has been tested and works well in:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

## Future Improvements

Some suggestions for future enhancements:
- Add dark mode theming
